// @kgpacks/query — Cypher-RAG stage (ENHANCEMENTS).
//
// Asks a generator for a Cypher query, runs it through the CORE `validateCypher`
// allow-list FAIL-CLOSED, executes the validated query, and maps the rows into
// `RetrieverResult[]`. The generator's output is UNTRUSTED input: a non-read-only,
// write/DDL, or variable-length-path query is rejected with `CypherValidationError`
// and never reaches the database. It augments — never replaces — the safe vector
// path.
